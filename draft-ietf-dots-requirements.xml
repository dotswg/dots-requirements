<t>This document defines the requirements for the Distributed Denial of Service
(DDoS) Open Threat Signaling (DOTS) protocols coordinating attack response
against DDoS attacks.</t>

<section anchor="problems" title="Introduction">

<section anchor="context-and-motivation" title="Context and Motivation">
<t>Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks continue to plague networks
around the globe, from Tier-1 service providers on down to enterprises and
small businesses. Attack scale and frequency similarly have continued to
increase, in part as a result of software vulnerabilities leading to reflection
and amplification attacks. Once staggering attack traffic volume is now the
norm, and the impact of larger-scale attacks attract the attention of
international press agencies.</t>

<t>The greater impact of contemporary DDoS attacks has led to increased focus on
coordinated attack response. Many institutions and enterprises lack the
resources or expertise to operate on-premise attack mitigation solutions
themselves, or simply find themselves constrained by local bandwidth
limitations. To address such gaps, security service providers have begun to
offer on-demand traffic scrubbing services, which aim to separate the DDoS
traffic from legitimate traffic and forward only the latter. Today each such
service offers its own interface for subscribers to request attack mitigation,
tying subscribers to proprietary implementations while also limiting the subset
of network elements capable of participating in the attack response. As a result
of incompatibility across services, attack responses may be fragmentary or
otherwise incomplete, leaving key players in the attack path unable to assist in
the defense.</t>

<t>The lack of a common method to coordinate a real-time response among involved
actors and network domains inhibits the speed and effectiveness of DDoS attack
mitigation. This document describes the required characteristics of a DOTS
protocol enabling requests for DDoS attack mitigation, reducing attack impact
and leading to more efficient defensive strategies.</t>

<t>DOTS communicates the need for defensive action in anticipation of or in
response to an attack, but does not dictate the form any defensive action
takes. DOTS supplements calls for help with pertinent details about the detected
attack, allowing entities participating in DOTS to form ad hoc, adaptive
alliances against DDoS attacks as described in the DOTS use cases
<xref target="I-D.ietf-dots-use-cases"></xref>. The requirements in this document are derived from
those use cases and <xref target="I-D.ietf-dots-architecture"></xref>.</t>

<t>The key words &ldquo;MUST&rdquo;, &ldquo;MUST NOT&rdquo;, &ldquo;REQUIRED&rdquo;, &ldquo;SHALL&rdquo;, &ldquo;SHALL NOT&rdquo;,
&ldquo;SHOULD&rdquo;, &ldquo;SHOULD NOT&rdquo;, &ldquo;RECOMMENDED&rdquo;, &ldquo;MAY&rdquo;, and &ldquo;OPTIONAL&rdquo; in this
document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>

<t>This document adopts the following terms:</t>

<t><list style="hanging">
  <t hangText='DDoS:'>
  A distributed denial-of-service attack, in which traffic originating from
multiple sources are directed at a target on a network. DDoS attacks are
intended to cause a negative impact on the availability of servers, services,
applications, and/or other functionality of an attack target.
Denial-of-service considerations are discussed in detail in <xref target="RFC4732"></xref>.</t>
  <t hangText='DDoS attack target:'>
  A network connected entity with a finite set of resources, such as network
bandwidth,  memory or CPU, that is the focus of a DDoS attack. Potential
targets include network elements, servers, and services.</t>
  <t hangText='DDoS attack telemetry:'>
  Collected behavioral characteristics defining the nature of a DDoS attack.</t>
  <t hangText='Countermeasure:'>

traffic while passing legitimate traffic to the attack target.</t>
  <t hangText='Mitigation:'>
  A set of countermeasures enforced against traffic destined for the target or
targets of a detected or reported DDoS attack, where countermeasure
enforcement is managed by an entity in the network path between attack sources
and the attack target. Mitigation methodology is out of scope for this
document.</t>
  <t hangText='Mitigator:'>
  An entity, typically a network element, capable of performing mitigation of a
detected or reported DDoS attack. For the purposes of this document, this

  A DOTS-aware software module responsible for requesting attack response
coordination with other DOTS-aware elements.</t>
  <t hangText='DOTS server:'>
  A DOTS-aware software module handling and responding to messages from DOTS
clients. The DOTS server SHOULD enable mitigation on behalf of the DOTS
client, if requested, by communicating the DOTS client&rsquo;s request to the
mitigator and returning selected mitigator feedback to the requesting DOTS
client. A DOTS server MAY also be a mitigator.</t>
  <t hangText='DOTS agent:'>
  Any DOTS-aware software module capable of participating in a DOTS signaling
session.</t>
  <t hangText='DOTS gateway:'>
  A logical DOTS agent resulting from the logical concatenation of a DOTS server

packet loss, such as a volumetric DDoS attack causing network congestion.</t>
  <t hangText='DOTS signal:'>
  A concise authenticated status/control message transmitted between DOTS
agents, used to indicate client&rsquo;s need for mitigation, as well as to convey
the status of any requested mitigation.</t>
  <t hangText='Heartbeat:'>
  A message transmitted between DOTS agents over the signal channel, used as a
keep-alive and to measure peer health.</t>
  <t hangText='Client signal:'>
  A message sent from a DOTS client to a DOTS server over the signal channel,
indicating the DOTS client&rsquo;s need for mitigation, as well as the scope of any
requested mitigation, optionally including additional attack details to
supplement server-initiated mitigation.</t>
  <t hangText='Server signal:'>
  A message sent from a DOTS server to a DOTS client over the signal channel.
Note that a server signal is not a response to client signal, but a DOTS
server-initiated status message sent to DOTS clients with which the server has
established signaling sessions.</t>
  <t hangText='Data channel:'>
  A secure communication layer between DOTS clients and DOTS servers used for
infrequent bulk exchange of data not easily or appropriately communicated
through the signal channel under attack conditions.</t>

from which traffic should always be allowed, regardless of contradictory data
gleaned in a detected attack.</t>
  <t hangText='Multi-homed DOTS client:'>
  A DOTS client exchanging messages with multiple DOTS servers, each in a
separate administrative domain.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="requirements" title="Requirements">

<t>This section describes the required features and characteristics of the DOTS
protocol.</t>

<t>DOTS is an advisory protocol. An active DDoS attack against the entity
controlling the DOTS client need not be present before establishing DOTS
communication between DOTS agents. Indeed, establishing a relationship with peer
DOTS agents during normal network conditions provides the foundation for more
rapid attack response against future attacks, as all interactions setting up
DOTS, including any business or service level agreements, are already complete.</t>

<t>DOTS must at a minimum make it possible for a DOTS client to request a DOTS
server&rsquo;s aid in mounting a coordinated defense against a suspected attack,
signaling within or between domains as requested by local operators. DOTS
clients should similarly be able to withdraw aid requests. DOTS requires no
justification from DOTS clients for requests for help, nor do DOTS clients need
to justify withdrawing help requests: the decision is local to the DOTS clients&rsquo;
domain. Regular feedback between DOTS clients and DOTS server supplement the
defensive alliance by maintaining a common understanding of DOTS peer health and
activity. Bidirectional communication between DOTS clients and DOTS servers is
therefore critical.</t>

<t>Yet DOTS must also work with a set of competing operational goals.
On the one hand, the protocol must be resilient under extremely hostile network
conditions, providing continued contact between DOTS agents even as attack
traffic saturates the link. Such resiliency may be developed several ways, but
characteristics such as small message size, asynchronous, redundant message
delivery and minimal connection overhead (when possible given local network
policy) will tend to contribute to the robustness demanded by a viable DOTS
protocol. Operators of peer DOTS-enabled domains may enable quality- or
class-of-service traffic tagging to increase the probability of successful DOTS
signal delivery, but DOTS requires no such policies be in place. The DOTS
solution indeed must be viable especially in their absence.</t>

<t>On the other hand, DOTS must include protections ensuring message
confidentiality, integrity and authenticity to keep the protocol from becoming
another vector for the very attacks it&rsquo;s meant to help fight off. DOTS clients
must be able to authenticate DOTS servers, and vice versa, for DOTS to operate
safely, meaning the DOTS agents must have a way to negotiate and agree upon the
terms of protocol security. Attacks against the transport protocol should not
offer a means of attack against the message confidentiality, integrity and
authenticity.</t>

<t>The DOTS server and client must also have some common method of defining the
scope of any mitigation performed by the mitigator, as well as making
adjustments to other commonly configurable features, such as listen ports,
exchanging black- and white-lists, and so on.</t>

<t>Finally, DOTS should provide sufficient extensibility to meet local, vendor or
future needs in coordinated attack defense, although this consideration is
necessarily superseded by the other operational requirements.</t>

<section anchor="general-requirements" title="General Requirements">

<t><list style="hanging">
  <t hangText='GEN-001'>
  Extensibility: Protocols and data models developed as part of DOTS MUST be
extensible in order to keep DOTS adaptable to operational and proprietary
DDoS defenses. Future extensions MUST be backward compatible.</t>
  <t hangText='GEN-002'>
  Resilience and Robustness: The signaling protocol MUST be designed to maximize
the probability of signal delivery even under the severely constrained network
conditions imposed by particular attack traffic. The protocol MUST be
resilient, that is, continue operating despite message loss and out-of-order
or redundant message delivery.</t>
  <t hangText='GEN-003'>
  Bidirectionality: To support peer health detection, to maintain an open
signal channel, and to increase the probability of signal delivery during
attack, the signal channel MUST be bidirectional, with client and server
transmitting signals to each other at regular intervals, regardless of any
client request for mitigation. Unidirectional messages MUST be supported
within the bidirectional signal channel to allow for unsolicited message
delivery, enabling asynchronous notifications between agents.</t>
  <t hangText='GEN-004'>
  Sub-MTU Message Size: To avoid message fragmentation and the consequently
decreased probability of message delivery, signaling protocol message size
MUST be kept under signaling path Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU), including
the byte overhead of any encapsulation, transport headers, and transport- or
message-level security.</t>
  <t hangText='GEN-005'>
  Bulk Data Exchange: Infrequent bulk data exchange between DOTS agents can also
significantly augment attack response coordination, permitting such tasks as
population of black- or white-listed source addresses; address or prefix group
aliasing; exchange of incident reports; and other hinting or configuration
supplementing attack response.</t>
  <t>As the resilience requirements for the DOTS signal channel mandate small
signal message size, a separate, secure data channel utilizing a reliable
transport protocol MUST be used for bulk data exchange.</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="operational-requirements" title="Operational Requirements">

<t><list style="hanging">
  <t hangText='OP-001'>
  Use of Common Transport Protocols: DOTS MUST operate over common widely
deployed and standardized transport protocols. While the User Datagram
Protocol (UDP) <xref target="RFC0768"/> SHOULD be used for the signal channel, the
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) <xref target="RFC0793"></xref> MAY be used if necessary due to
network policy or middlebox capabilities or configurations. The data channel
MUST use a reliable transport; see <xref target="data-channel-requirements"/> below.</t>
  <t hangText='OP-002'>
  Session Health Monitoring: Peer DOTS agents MUST regularly send heartbeats to
each other after mutual authentication in order to keep the DOTS session
active.  A session MUST be considered active until a DOTS agent explicitly
ends the session, or either DOTS agent fails to receive heartbeats from the
other after a mutually agreed upon timeout period has elapsed.</t>
  <t hangText='OP-003'>
  Session Redirection: In order to increase DOTS operational flexibility and
scalability, DOTS servers SHOULD be able to redirect DOTS clients to another
DOTS server at any time. Due to the decreased probability of DOTS server
signal delivery due to link congestion, it is RECOMMENDED DOTS servers avoid
redirecting while mitigation is enabled during an active attack against a
target in the DOTS client&rsquo;s domain. Either the DOTS servers have to fate-share
the security state, the client MUST have separate security state with each
potential redirectable server, or be able to negotiate new state as part of
redirection.</t>
  <t hangText='OP-004'>
  Mitigation Status: DOTS MUST provide a means to report the status of an action
requested by a DOTS client. In particular, DOTS clients MUST be able to
request or withdraw a request for mitigation from the DOTS server. The DOTS
server MUST acknowledge a DOTS client&rsquo;s request to withdraw from coordinated
attack response in subsequent signals, and MUST cease mitigation activity as
quickly as possible.  However, a DOTS client rapidly toggling active
mitigation may result in undesirable side-effects for the network path, such
as route or DNS <xref target="RFC1034"></xref> flapping.  A DOTS server therefore MAY continue
mitigating for a mutually negotiated period after receiving the DOTS client&rsquo;s
request to stop.</t>
  <t>A server MAY refuse to engage in coordinated attack response with a client.
To make the status of a client&rsquo;s request clear, the server MUST indicate in
server signals whether client-initiated mitigation is active. When a
client-initiated mitigation is active, and threat handling details such as
mitigation scope and statistics are available to the server, the server
SHOULD include those details in server signals sent to the client. DOTS
clients SHOULD take mitigation statistics into account when deciding whether
to request the DOTS server cease mitigation.</t>
  <t hangText='OP-005'>
  Mitigation Lifetime: A DOTS client SHOULD indicate the desired lifetime of any
mitigation requested from the DOTS server. As DDoS attack duration is
unpredictable, the DOTS client SHOULD be able to extend mitigation lifetime
with periodic renewed requests for help. When the mitigation lifetime comes to
an end, the DOTS server SHOULD delay session termination for a
protocol-defined grace period to allow for delivery of delayed mitigation
renewals over the signal channel. After the grace period elapses, the DOTS
server MAY terminate the session at any time.</t>
  <t>If a DOTS client does not include a mitigation lifetime in requests for help
sent to the DOTS server, the DOTS server will use a reasonable default as
defined by the protocol. As above, the DOTS client MAY extend a current
mitigation request&rsquo;s lifetime trivially with renewed requests for help.</t>
  <t>A DOTS client MAY also request an indefinite mitigation lifetime, enabling
architectures in which the mitigator is always in the traffic path to the
resources for which the DOTS client is requesting protection. DOTS servers MAY
refuse such requests for any reason. The reasons themselves are not in scope.</t>
  <t hangText='OP-006'>
  Mitigation Scope: DOTS clients MUST indicate the desired scope of any
mitigation, for example by using Classless Internet Domain Routing (CIDR)
<xref target="RFC1518"></xref>,<xref target="RFC1519"></xref> prefixes, <xref target="RFC2373"></xref> for IPv6 <xref target="RFC2460"></xref> prefixes, the
length/prefix convention established in the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
<xref target="RFC4271"></xref>, SIP URIs <xref target="RFC3261"/>, E.164 numbers, DNS names, or by a resource
group alias agreed upon with the server through the data channel.</t>
  <t>If there is additional information available narrowing the scope of any
requested attack response, such as targeted port range, protocol, or service,
DOTS clients SHOULD include that information in client signals. DOTS clients
MAY also include additional attack details. Such supplemental information is
OPTIONAL, and DOTS servers MAY ignore it when enabling countermeasures on the
mitigator.</t>
  <t>As an active attack evolves, clients MUST be able to adjust as necessary the
scope of requested mitigation by refining the scope of resources requiring
mitigation.</t>
  <t hangText='OP-007'>
  Mitigation Efficacy: When a mitigation request by a DOTS client is active,
DOTS clients SHOULD transmit a metric of perceived mitigation efficacy to the
DOTS server, per &ldquo;Automatic or Operator-Assisted CPE or PE Mitigators Request
Upstream DDoS Mitigation Services&rdquo; in <xref target="I-D.ietf-dots-use-cases"></xref>. DOTS servers
MAY use the efficacy metric to adjust countermeasures activated on a mitigator
on behalf of a DOTS client.</t>
  <t hangText='OP-008'>
  Conflict Detection and Notification: Multiple DOTS clients controlled by a
single administrative entity may send conflicting mitigation requests for pool
of protected resources , as a result of misconfiguration, operator error, or
compromised DOTS clients. DOTS servers attempting to honor conflicting
requests may flap network route or DNS information, degrading the networks
attempting to participate in attack response with the DOTS clients. DOTS
servers SHALL detect such conflicting requests, and SHALL notify the DOTS
clients in conflict. The notification SHOULD indicate the nature and scope of
the conflict, for example, the overlapping prefix range in a conflicting
mitigation request.</t>
  <t hangText='OP-009:'>
  Network Address Translator Traversal: The DOTS protocol MUST operate over
networks in which Network Address Translation (NAT) is deployed. As UDP is the
recommended transport for the DOTS signal channel, all considerations in
&ldquo;Middlebox Traversal Guidelines&rdquo; in <xref target="RFC5405"></xref> apply to DOTS. Regardless of
transport, DOTS protocols MUST follow established best common practices (BCPs)
for NAT traversal.</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="data-channel-requirements" title="Data Channel Requirements">

<t>The data channel is intended to be used for bulk data exchanges between DOTS
agents. Unlike the signal channel, which must operate nominally even when
confronted with signal degradation due to packet loss, the data channel is not
expected to be constructed to deal with attack conditions.  As the primary
function of the data channel is data exchange, a reliable transport is required
in order for DOTS agents to detect data delivery success or failure.</t>

<t>The data channel must be extensible. We anticipate the data channel will be used
for such purposes as configuration or resource discovery.  For example, a DOTS
client may submit to the DOTS server a collection of prefixes it wants to refer
to by alias when requesting mitigation, to which the server would respond with a
success status and the new prefix group alias, or an error status and message in
the event the DOTS client&rsquo;s data channel request failed. The transactional
nature of such data exchanges suggests a separate set of requirements for the
data channel, while the potentially sensitive content sent between DOTS agents
requires extra precautions to ensure data privacy and authenticity.</t>

<t><list style="hanging">
  <t hangText='DATA-001'>
  Reliable transport: Messages sent over the data channel MUST be delivered
reliably, in order sent.</t>
  <t hangText='DATA-002'>
  Data privacy and integrity: Transmissions over the data channel are likely to
contain operationally or privacy-sensitive information or instructions from
the remote DOTS agent. Theft or modification of data channel transmissions
could lead to information leaks or malicious transactions on behalf of the
sending agent (see <xref target="security-considerations"/> below). Consequently data sent
over the data channel MUST be encrypted and authenticated using current
industry best practices.  DOTS servers MUST enable means to prevent leaking
operationally or privacy-sensitive data. Although administrative entities
participating in DOTS may detail what data may be revealed to third-party DOTS
agents, such considerations are not in scope for this document.</t>
  <t hangText='DATA-003'>
  Resource Configuration: To help meet the general and operational requirements
in this document, DOTS server implementations MUST provide an interface to
configure resource identifiers, as described in OP-007.

DOTS server implementations MAY expose additional configurability. Additional
configurability is implementation-specific.</t>
  <t hangText='DATA-004'>
  Black- and whitelist management: DOTS servers SHOULD provide methods for
DOTS clients to manage black- and white-lists of traffic destined for
resources belonging to a client.</t>
  <t>For example, a DOTS client should be able to create a black- or whitelist
entry; retrieve a list of current entries from either list; update the content
of either list; and delete entries as necessary.</t>
  <t>How the DOTS server determines client ownership of address space is not in
scope.</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="security-requirements" title="Security requirements">

<t>DOTS must operate within a particularly strict security context, as an
insufficiently protected signal or data channel may be subject to abuse,
enabling or supplementing the very attacks DOTS purports to mitigate.</t>

<t><list style="hanging">
  <t hangText='SEC-001'>
  Peer Mutual Authentication: DOTS agents MUST authenticate each other before a
DOTS session is considered valid. The method of authentication is not
specified, but should follow current industry best practices with respect to
any cryptographic mechanisms to authenticate the remote peer.</t>
  <t hangText='SEC-002'>
  Message Confidentiality, Integrity and Authenticity: DOTS protocols MUST take
steps to protect the confidentiality, integrity and authenticity of messages
sent between client and server. While specific transport- and message-level
security options are not specified, the protocols MUST follow current industry
best practices for encryption and message authentication.</t>
  <t>In order for DOTS protocols to remain secure despite advancements in
cryptanalysis and traffic analysis, DOTS agents MUST be able to negotiate the
terms and mechanisms of protocol security, subject to the interoperability and
signal message size requirements above.</t>
  <t>While the interfaces between downstream DOTS server and upstream DOTS client
within a DOTS gateway are implementation-specific, those interfaces
nevertheless MUST provide security equivalent to that of the signaling
sessions bridged by gateways in the signaling path. For example, when a DOTS
gateway consisting of a DOTS server and DOTS client is running on the same
logical device, they must be within the same process security boundary.</t>
  <t hangText='SEC-003'>
  Message Replay Protection: In order to prevent a passive attacker from
capturing and replaying old messages, DOTS protocols MUST provide a method
for replay detection.</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="data-model-requirements" title="Data Model Requirements">

<t>The value of DOTS is in standardizing a mechanism to permit elements, networks
or domains under or under threat of DDoS attack to request aid mitigating the
effects of any such attack. A well-structured DOTS data model is therefore
critical to the development of a successful DOTS protocol.</t>

<t><list style="hanging">
  <t hangText='DM-001:'>
  Structure: The data model structure for the DOTS protocol may be described by
a single module, or be divided into related collections of hierarchical
modules and sub-modules. If the data model structure is split across modules,
those distinct modules MUST allow references to describe the overall data
model&rsquo;s structural dependencies.</t>
  <t hangText='DM-002:'>
  Versioning: To ensure interoperability between DOTS protocol implementations,
data models MUST be versioned. The version number of the initial data model
SHALL be 1. Each published change to the initial published DOTS data model
SHALL increment the data model version by 1.</t>
  <t>How the protocol represents data model versions is not defined in this
document.</t>
  <t hangText='DM-003:'>
  Mitigation Status Representation: The data model MUST provide the ability to
represent a request for mitigation and the withdrawal of such a request. The
data model MUST also support a representation of currently requested
mitigation status, including failures and their causes.</t>
  <t hangText='DM-004:'>
  Mitigation Scope Representation: The data model MUST support representation of
a requested mitigation&rsquo;s scope. As mitigation scope may be represented in
several different ways, per OP-006 above, the data model MUST be capable of
flexible representation of mitigation scope.</t>
  <t hangText='DM-005:'>
  Mitigation Lifetime Representation: The data model MUST support representation
of a mitigation request&rsquo;s lifetime, including mitigations with no specified
end time.</t>
  <t hangText='DM-006:'>
  Mitigation Efficacy Representation: The data model MUST support representation
of a DOTS client&rsquo;s understanding of the efficacy of a mitigation enabled
through a mitigation request.</t>
  <t hangText='DM-007:'>
  Acceptable Signal Loss Representation: The data model MUST be able to
represent the DOTS agent&rsquo;s preference for acceptable signal loss when
establishing a signaling session, as described in GEN-002.</t>

  Heartbeat Interval Representation: The data model MUST be able to represent
the DOTS agent&rsquo;s preferred heartbeat interval, which the client may include
when establishing the signal channel, as described in OP-002.</t>

  Relationship to Transport: The DOTS data model MUST NOT depend on the
specifics of any transport to represent fields in the model.</t>

<section anchor="signal-channel" title="Signal Channel">

<t>As part of a protocol expected to operate over links affected by DDoS attack
traffic, the DOTS signal channel MUST NOT contribute significantly to link
congestion. To meet the operational requirements above, DOTS signal channel
implementations MUST support UDP. However, UDP when deployed naively can be a
source of network congestion, as discussed in <xref target="RFC5405"></xref>. Signal channel
implementations using UDP MUST therefore include a congestion control mechanism.
The form of that congestion control is implementation-specific.</t>

<t>Signal channel implementations using TCP may rely on built-in TCP congestion
control support.</t>

<section anchor="data-channel" title="Data Channel">
<t>As specified in DATA-001, the data channel requires reliable, in-order message
delivery. Data channel implementations using TCP may rely on the TCP
implementation&rsquo;s built-in congestion control mechanisms.</t>

<t>DOTS is at risk from three primary attacks:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>DOTS agent impersonation</t>
  <t>Traffic injection</t>
  <t>Signaling blocking</t>
</list></t>

<t>The DOTS protocol MUST be designed for minimal data transfer to address the
blocking risk. Impersonation and traffic injection mitigation can be managed
through current secure communications best practices. See
<xref target="security-requirements"/> above for a detailed discussion.</t>
